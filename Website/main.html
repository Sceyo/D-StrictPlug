				<h2>District Plug</h2>
				<p>District plug is a local website here in Cebu, that features everything local here. All the scenes and events from fashion trends or apparels, to music from local artist, to the esports players and events being held here in Cebu, and amazing local artists ranging from painters to photographers. Cebu is a wonderful place, full of life and culture. Cebu, for the District Plug, is like an untapped hidden treasure waiting to be discoverd. The District Plug is about injecting the local scenes such as art, music esports and apparel brands into the mainstream media. Since the local scene is not acknowledged as much here in our own province. The website is all about showing to other people what our Local artists can do and what they are capable of. </p>

				<h2>How did you come up District Plug?</h2>
				<p>Ever since I was in the 8th Grade, I started having the passion of supporting local things here in Cebu. Since I enjoyed going out, adventuring, enjoying sceneries and lastly enjoying the local culture here in Cebu. I wanted to make the local scene deserving of the attention it needed. Since Cebu is full of wonders from, up and coming artist starting at 18yo and making a name for himself or a young girl with so much talent and potential in the art of photography. Cebu is really an untapped gem, but why the name district plug? Well district comes from the places or districts here in Cebu where local things happen and plug is like the source of power or source of idea and potential that's just waiting.</p>
